# Interview Scheduler

Scheduler is a full-stack application built in React that uses a database (set up in PostgreSQL), hosted on a server and connected through a web socket to allow clients to book interviews with a set of daily interviewers, to view existing booked appointments, and to edit or cancel their interviews.

## Features

This project employs the following features from this and last week's learning material.

### Designed in Storybook

Front-end design features and dynamics were put together in Storybook.  

### Axios Requests

This project uses Axios requests (get, put, and delete) to retrieve and alter the database. 

### Robust Testing

This project has been tested--A LOT--in Jest, Cypress, and using CircleCI. This application has 94% coverage! Yay! We love testing! 

### React Functional Components, States, and Hooks

This project makes great use of React functional components, several states and effects, and even a few custom hooks! There's also a nifty little reducer in there to make the code nice and DRY.
