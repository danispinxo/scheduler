# Interview Scheduler

## Features

This project employs the following features from this and last week's learning material.

### Designed in Storybook

Front-end design features and dynamics were put together in Storybook.  

### Axios Requests

This project uses Axios requests (get, put, and delete) to retrieve and alter the database. 

### Robust Testing

This project has been tested--A LOT--in Jest, Cypress, and using CircleCI. This application has 94% coverage! Yay! We love testing! 

### React Functional Components, States, and Hooks

This project makes great use of React functional components, several states and effects, and even a few custom hooks! There's also a nifty little reducer in there to make the code nice and DRY. 

## Acknowledgements

A big thank you to the lecturers and mentors from this and last week! ESPECIALLY Ahana, but a big shout out to Frances who came in at the end and really helped things out. Thank you so much!
